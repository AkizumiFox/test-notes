# Foundations {.unnumbered}

This part covers the fundamental concepts of linear algebra that form the foundation for all subsequent material.

## Overview

In this part, we will explore:

- **Vector Spaces**: The abstract framework for studying linear structures
- **Linear Maps**: Transformations that preserve linear structure

These concepts are essential for understanding spectral theory and optimization techniques covered in later parts.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, readers should be familiar with:

- Basic matrix operations (addition, multiplication, transpose)
- Systems of linear equations
- Elementary row operations and Gaussian elimination
