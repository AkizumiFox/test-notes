# Linear Maps

## Introduction

Linear maps are functions between vector spaces that preserve the linear structure. They are the natural morphisms in the category of vector spaces.

## Definition

::: {#def-linear-map}
## Linear Map
Let $V$ and $W$ be vector spaces over $\R$. A function $T: V \to W$ is called a **linear map** (or linear transformation) if for all $\bu, \bv \in V$ and $a \in \R$:

1. $T(\bu + \bv) = T(\bu) + T(\bv)$ (additivity)
2. $T(a\bv) = aT(\bv)$ (homogeneity)
:::

Equivalently, $T$ is linear if and only if $T(a\bu + b\bv) = aT(\bu) + bT(\bv)$ for all vectors and scalars.

## Fundamental Subspaces

::: {#def-kernel}
## Kernel and Image
Let $T: V \to W$ be a linear map.

- The **kernel** (or null space) of $T$ is $\ker(T) = \{\bv \in V : T(\bv) = \mathbf{0}\}$
- The **image** (or range) of $T$ is $\text{im}(T) = \{T(\bv) : \bv \in V\}$

::: {#thm-rank-nullity}
## Rank-Nullity Theorem
Let $T: V \to W$ be a linear map where $V$ is finite-dimensional. Then:
$$
\dim(V) = \dim(\ker(T)) + \dim(\text{im}(T))
$$
