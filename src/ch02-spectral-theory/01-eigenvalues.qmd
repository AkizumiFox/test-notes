# Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

## Introduction

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors reveal the intrinsic properties of linear transformations. They tell us about the directions in which a transformation acts by simple scaling.

::: {.content-hidden when-meta="standalone-pdf"}
Recall from @def-vector-space that a vector space is a set with addition and scalar multiplication satisfying certain axioms.

::: {.content-visible when-meta="standalone-pdf"}
Recall from Definition (Vector Space) that a vector space is a set with addition and scalar multiplication satisfying certain axioms.

Here we study special vectors that behave simply under linear maps.

## Definitions

::: {#def-eigenvalue}
## Eigenvalue and Eigenvector
Let $\bA \in \R^{n \times n}$. A scalar $\lambda \in \C$ is called an **eigenvalue** of $\bA$ if there exists a non-zero vector $\bv \in \C^n$ such that:
$$
\bA\bv = \lambda\bv
$$
The vector $\bv$ is called an **eigenvector** corresponding to $\lambda$.
:::

::: {#def-characteristic}
## Characteristic Polynomial
The **characteristic polynomial** of $\bA$ is:
$$
p(\lambda) = \det(\bA - \lambda\bI)
$$
The eigenvalues of $\bA$ are the roots of $p(\lambda)$.
:::

## Properties

::: {#thm-symmetric-real}
## Real Eigenvalues of Symmetric Matrices
If $\bA \in \R^{n \times n}$ is symmetric, then all eigenvalues of $\bA$ are real.
:::

::: {.proof}
Let $\lambda$ be an eigenvalue with eigenvector $\bv$. Taking the conjugate transpose of $\bA\bv = \lambda\bv$:
$$
\bar{\bv}^\top \bA = \bar{\lambda} \bar{\bv}^\top
$$
Multiplying both sides on the right by $\bv$ and using symmetry of $\bA$:
$$
\bar{\bv}^\top \bA \bv = \bar{\lambda} \bar{\bv}^\top \bv = \bar{\lambda} \norm{\bv}^2
$$
But also $\bar{\bv}^\top \bA \bv = \bar{\bv}^\top (\lambda \bv) = \lambda \norm{\bv}^2$.
Thus $\lambda = \bar{\lambda}$, so $\lambda \in \R$.

## Exercises

::: {#exr-trace-det}
## Trace and Determinant
Prove that for any $\bA \in \R^{n \times n}$:

1. $\trace(\bA) = \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i$
2. $\det(\bA) = \prod_{i=1}^n \lambda_i$

where $\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n$ are the eigenvalues of $\bA$ (counting multiplicity).
